# Project: File Server System using Socket Programming
This is a simple GUI based File Server system which allowse one(a client) to upload files to server and also download from it. Its made using socket programming and the codes are written with only JAVA.
In a file server system, a file server is responsible for the central storage and management of data files so that other clients on the same network can access the files. Clients from various ports can access the sever. Clients can upload files from the client program and also download the desired file from the server. They can also choose to delete the files from the server.

# How the system works:
- When we open the server first it opens a server socket like the image below and starts operating. ![](https://github.com/PulockDas/Networking-Project/blob/main/Images/1.png)
- After that when the client programme is run it opens a window like this.![](https://github.com/PulockDas/Networking-Project/blob/main/Images/2.png)
